Programming Assignments (Algorithms, Part I by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick)

## Part I

PA-1 Percolation (Union-find)
###
		Project: 
      Percolation -- Application of the Weighted Quick Union in order to simulate a "percolation" and to obtain the percolation threshold for a particular N*N grid size.
    Specification: 
			http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html
		Code:
			Percolation.java;
			PercolationStats.java
	
PA-2 Randomized Queues and Deques (Queue and Stack)
###
		Project: 
      Randomized Queues, and Deques -- Implementation of a randomized queue, and a deque.
    Specification:
			http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html
		Code:
			Deque.java;
			RandomizedQueue.java;
			Subset.java

PA-3 Pattern Recognition (Sort)
###
		Project: 
      Collinear Points -- Using more sophistacated and tuned sorting algorithms, develop a fast method for finding collinear points. A brute force method was also developed to contrast the runtimes between the efficient method and the naive solution.
    Specification:
			http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html
		Code:
			Point.java;
			Brute.java;
			Fast.java

PA-4 8 Puzzle (Priority Queues)
###
		Project: 
      8-Puzzle -- Implement an A* search to find a solution to the 8-puzzle.
    Specification:
			http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html
		Code:
			Point.java;
			Board.java;
			Solver.java

PA-5 Kd-Tree (Balanced Search Trees)
###
		Project: 
      Kd tree -- Using the concept of binary search trees, implement a two dimensional kd tree.
    Specification:
			http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html
		Code:
			PointSET.java;
			KdTree.java
